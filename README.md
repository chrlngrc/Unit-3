# Healthcare Costs And Child Mortality

## About
This repository contains a refined dataset created with the `County_Health_Data`, which is included in the Data folder. The new dataset contains information on the healthcare costs and mortality rates in states across the United States. The `Creating_Subset` file contains instructional material on how to filter data and create a smaller subset. The repository also include `Python Basics` for basic instructions on using the Python program.

## Data

This dataset was created for the public to both healthcare costs and child mortality rates in the United States. It could potentially be used to show whether or not there is a correlation between healthcare costs and child mortality rates. It could also show what states are higher and lower mortality rates, as well as the healthcare costs in those states. The public may use this data to begin other analyses of this relationship in states. 
I chose to focus in on this topic because there is a good chance that healthcare costs have a large impact on the rate of child mortality. If we can acknowledge this, it may lead to more studies being done on how to help this issue.
